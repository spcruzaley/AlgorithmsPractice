# Merge Sort

### Description
The quick sort is one the most efficient algorithms, it was developed by the British [Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare).

This is an algorithm that uses recursion, it works like a binary search tree, we start with a ***Pivot*** and with an initial validation between the ***Pivot*** a ***Left Pointer*** and a ***Right Pointer***, after that we will to do the same process in the array's left side starting from ***pivot*** until ***left pointer*** (*minus 1*) and also in the array's right side starting from ***left point*** until ***array's length*** (*minus 1*)
