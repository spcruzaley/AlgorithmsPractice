# Bubble Sort

### Description
This is the beginner algorithm to sort an array, it has a very low performance due to, in all cases we will to have a O(N^2) complexity.

It starts taken the first element, and compare with all the rest elements in the array, once finish, will take the second element and do the same, and so on and so fourth.
Each time a validation its made if the first elements its less than the other we will to swap them.

Commonly this algorithm its made ***in place*** (**The input array will be updated in the sorting process**)
