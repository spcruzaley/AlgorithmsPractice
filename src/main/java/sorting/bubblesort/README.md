# Bubble Sort

### Description
This is the beginner algorithm to sort an array, it has a very low performance due to, in all cases we will to have a O(N^2) complexity.

It starts taken the first element, and compare with all the rest elements in the array, once finish, will take the second element and do the same, and so on and so fort.
Each time a validation its made if the first elements its less   than the other (or the other way around), we will to swap them.

An important thing, its that 

Commonly this algorithm its made ***in place*** (**The input array will be updated in the sorting process**)
