/**
 * Last night you partied a little too hard. Now there's a black and white photo of you that's about to go viral!
 * You can't let this ruin your reputation, so you want to apply the box blur algorithm to the photo to hide its content.
 *
 * The pixels in the input image are represented as integers. The algorithm distorts the input image in the following way:
 * Every pixel x in the output image has a value equal to the average value of the pixel values from the 3 Ã— 3 square
 * that has its center at x, including x itself. All the pixels on the border of x are then removed.
 *
 * Return the blurred image as an integer, with the fractions rounded down.
